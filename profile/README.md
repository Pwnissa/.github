### 🐴 Who we are

We are **PWNISSA**, a group of CTF enthusiasts, cybersecurity students, and horse races addicts based in **Genova, Italy 🇮🇹**,  mostly made up of students from the **Università di Genova**. In our free time we eat [panissa](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panissa_(gastronomia_ligure)) and read segfaults like bedtime stories.

### 💥 What we do

* 🏆 Compete in **Capture The Flag** events.
* 🔐 Study security topics (pwn, RE, web, crypto, network).
* 📂 Share writeups & challenges for the community.
* 🎓 Host an Academy for students and aspiring hackers. *(coming soon 👀)*
